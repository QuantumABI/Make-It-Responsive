        <h2>What makes us unique?</h2>
        <p>
          Inova is a newly founded company specializing in frugal innovation. We
          believe everyone has the right to new technology and we wish to bring
          this experience to developing countries. Our company aims to create
          modern solutions to make more, with less. To create products in
          countries with limited money and resources as well as turn low value
          into high value.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes us different from other innovators? We do not chase the
          next big thing! Not to mention we do not use tons of natural resources
          to create more complex products. We want to keep the earth flourishing
          to ensure a sustainable future, for all. <br />The way we can achieve
          that is by using clean energy and materials that are easily
          accessible, while not being harmful to the environment. Together we
          will innovate solutions for everyone, to give the whole world the
          technology they deserve.

        <h2>Innovation Camps</h2>
        <p>
          Because our company firmly believes that the whole world has the right
          to new technology and that frugal innovation is the key. However, we
          cannot solve this alone, therefore we are hosing innovation camps to
          spread our knowledge about this topic as well as teach you how to use
          this to help developing countries in obtaining modern technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          At our innovation camps, you will be able to grasp the concept of how
          to strip devices for components that are not essential to the
          functioning of the device, along with increasing the durability of
          devices to keep them last longer in tougher environments. We believe
          that is the key factor in bringing sustainable technology to the
          world. Additionally, the camps will have courses on how to think
          innovatively and how you can change the world with an invention.
          <br />In our camps, we will have labs where you can create, be
          hands-on, and try out the knowledge we provide on frugal innovation.
          Who knows? Maybe you'll make the next breakthrough, right here in our
          labs.
